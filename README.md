# Out-Of-Body
The Out of Body Journal

Oneness and One
In 2017, Prince Paul Mamakos summarized the three stages of out of body experience. The first stage being achieving an out-of-body experience and experiencing movement within the environment near the physical body. The second stage being going out and exploring outside ones house, going off planet, going into the planet and meeting other beings. In the third stage of OBEs, a person begins to notice the energy within another being as the same as that which is coming out of their own being. The energy essence of another, is the same as your energy. In the culmination of the third stage, a person experiences a sense of connection with all beings. On a linear range of awareness, if we place personality at a proximal point on a line, a point on the opposite end of the line will represent an experience of oneness. Personality and oneness representing opposite extremes of awareness. Further dropping oneness results in the 'it' experience. One. 

The Out of Body Journal explores living reality. See the wiki for the most recent issue of Out Of Body.
