# **Out of Body Journal**
### **Oneness and One**
In [2017](https://www.amazon.com/Golden-One-Body-Book-Oneness-ebook/dp/B072LXLSDW), Prince Paul Mamakos summarized the three stages of out of body experience. 
1. The **first stage** is achieving an out-of-body experience (OBE) and experiencing movement within the environment near the physical body. 
2. The **second stage** is going out and exploring outside one's house, going off planet, going into the planet and meeting other beings. On-ness, in-ness, through-ness, presence. 
3. In the **third stage** of OBEs, a person begins to notice the energy within another being as the same as that which is coming out of their own being. The energy essence of another, is the same as your energy. In the culmination of the third stage, a person experiences a sense of connection with all beings. When 'other' disappears there is only 'it', one. 

On a linear range of awareness, if we place personality at a proximal point on a line, a point on the opposite end of the line will represent an experience of oneness. Personality and oneness representing opposite extremes of awareness. Further dropping oneness results in the 'it' experience. One. 

Out of Body, is a journal exploring living reality. Out-of-body experiences are an actual science. As a focal point, this journal helps travelers explore and share their experiences of the out of body sciences.

### Introduction
What follows is 2 years of training to go out of body. In this issue, we show the persistence needed to eventually experience an out of body experience. You will read about the sequence of energetic events and emotional changes that Prince Paul experienced which are the foundation of a spiritual awakening. What you'll read in the experiences is the the way I wrote them after awakening in my body. First I'd write the most important pieces of information that I did not want to forget. Then I'd write additional pieces of information from my experiences that would come to me while or after I'd written the most important info. I'd do this because â€¦

### Why learn? What Makes Out Of Body Experiences So Special? 
Many things will make more sense to you after you have had an out of body experience (the first stage). After you reach the second stage, the following points will make sense:

1. When countries go to war over religion because they don't understand the reality of spirit, then out of body knowledge becomes important. 

2. When countries build spaceships and rockets to get to the moon and other planets in order to look around a little, and those ships cost millions and billions of dollars/yen/Franks/etc., when you can go to the moon in 5 minutes out of body, then out of body ability becomes important. Taxes pay for these projects. 

3. When scientists spend big money on large telescopes and satellites looking for life in the universe, while out of body travelers meet other beings all the time whenever they like, then OBEs become useful for communication. 

4. It's super fun. One of the best most freeing and exciting things that you can do. 

5. Once you reach the third stage, 'you' are royal, in a universal sense. 

### How To Learn
* Going out of body requires a belief you can do it and preparation. Once you're on the edge of doing it, it also requires going beyond the fear of doing it. 

### What to Do
* Listen to people who have gone out of body, [read books](https://www.amazon.com/s?i=digital-text&rh=p_27%3APrince+Paul+Mamakos&s=relevancerank&text=Prince+Paul+Mamakos&ref=dp_byline_sr_ebooks_1), and [surround](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEwErLyJGcy5_XzyW79m0cg?disable_polymer=true) your waking mind with the subject of out of body experiences. 
* Buy [Binaural Beats](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=305687&u=2020065&m=25140&urllink=&afftrack=) and listen to them over and over. Your emotional body will unwind, and your mental body will get ready. Your energy will sync. And you will start having experiences. 
* Take classes in: [yoga](https://youtu.be/BxdI0X_bme0), [hatha yoga](https://youtu.be/cVIXbz9t4MM), acupuncture or moxibustion, tai chi, reiki.

# About
## Aims & Scope
Out Of Body is a weekly multidimensional journal publishing the finest out of body experiences in all fields of out-of-body science and multidimensional technology on the basis of its originality, importance, interdisciplinary interest, timeliness, accessibility, elegance and surprising conclusions. Out Of Body also provides rapid, authoritative, insightful and arresting news and interpretation of topical and coming trends affecting travelers, out of body science, and the wider multidimensional community.

## Out Of Body's mission statement
First, to serve out-of-body travelers through prompt publication of significant advances in any branch of [out-of-body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-body_experience) science, and to provide a forum for the reporting and discussion of news and issues concerning out-of-body science. Second, to ensure that the results of out-of-body science are rapidly disseminated to the multidimensional community throughout the cosmos, in a fashion that conveys their significance for knowledge, culture and daily life. Out-Of-Body's original mission statement was published for the first time on 26 January 2019.

## The Why
We want to be in an awakened world.

We want to be in a world where everybody is **aware** of the oneness, and of the out-of-body experiences, and the connectivity amongst us all. We are one being interacting with itself. And we want to be in an awakened world where that **is** the norm. Where that is everywhere. Through creating the Out Of Body Journal, we're moving ourselves in that direction, where we're in an awakened world.

## About the Editors
Like the other Out-Of-Body titles, Out-Of-Body has no external editorial board. Instead, all editorial decisions are made by a team of full-time professional travellers. Information about the out-of-body scientific background of the editors may be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/Golden-One-Body-Book-Oneness-ebook/dp/B072LXLSDW).
